# Taming-Time-in-Python
---
This repository was created while I was working on my Webscraping and Api project for cities information:

https://github.com/danodus22/scrapi-cities-info-app

During this time, I spent a lot of time dealing with the various international time and date formats.</br>
The result is this Jupyter Notebook, which contains many examples and is a kind of sandbox or playbook.

It can be used for practicing or trying things out to immerse yourself in the world of international time and date formats.

You can download it, simply open it and test various formats, conversions and libraries.
